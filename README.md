# react-context-auth-example

An example of authentication using React JS Context API.

Huge thanks to Akash Thakur for [this article](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/authentication-in-react-caf2abfa0494), on which this code is based. This repo will eventually deviate from the code in his article, after the tasks in the to do list below are ticked off.

## To Do:

-   Code-splitting and organisation
-   Add JWT and refresh token compatibility
    -   Add an API to use as an example

## Usage

1. Clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/sam-cross/react-context-auth-example <your-chosen-directory>`
2. Remove the origin remote with `git remote rm origin`
3. Add your new origin remote with `git remote add origin <your-git-repo-url>`
4. Push to your new repo with `git push -u origin main`, then start developing!
